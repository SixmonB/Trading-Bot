# Trading-Bot
This project was created with the idea of having a working bot trading in Binance according to real time parameters, as preset conditions meet with indicators from the site.

I worked with two friends from university but we never got the time to finish the project and we only managed to create a trading simulator to calibrate the 
indicators' settings.
